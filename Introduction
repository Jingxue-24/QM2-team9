Hi! My name is Jasmine; I’m from Italy but have lived in London for 7 years. I’m a second year Arts and Sciences student at UCL. 
My studies are focused on Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, but also venture into Philosophy for my minor. 
Aside from uni, I love to play the piano and the guitar, as well as travelling as much as possible (thanks corona).
