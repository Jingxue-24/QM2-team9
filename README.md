## What Are We Investigating? 🤔
Using [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and the [US Billboard Charts](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100), we are answering the question: ***How have the audio features of  popular songs evolved over the past 50 years?*** (NB: popular is defined as Top 20 US Billboard songs)
