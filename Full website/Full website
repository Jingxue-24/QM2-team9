The results from our analysis allowed us to create a range of visulation displaying the evolution of the audio feautures of the top hits songs since 1970.

- Radar Chart 

(Radar Chart 1)
We created a radar chart to display the mean audio feautures of the top '20 hit songs per year' per decade. 

We can observe that top hit songs did evolved trough decades. This phenonomenon is even more accentuated when comparing audiofeatures of 1970 to 1979 hit songs
and 2010 to 2019 hit songs.

(Radar Chart 2)

We can see that in 50 years there has been a sharp decrease in  accousticness. However, the Energy and Danceabilty of songs has increased. Other features
have remained quite stable trough years. 
We can observe that the change has been gradual with 80s and 90s songs having already less accousticness and more energy and Danciceability than 70s songs.
