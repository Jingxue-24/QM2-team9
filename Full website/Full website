(To be finished)

To perform our Analysis, we combined the Spotify API with the 'Top Hot 100 Billboard Chart'.

'Top Hot 100 Billboard chart'

The Hot 100 Billboard chart ranks the  most listened songs in the united states per year. Using this data set would really allow us to analyse the most popular
songs in the United States per year.

Within the top 100 billboard chart, we decided to only keep the top 20 songs per year. The top 20 really represented the most popular songs of the year known
by most people. Choosing 20 songs rather than less also left us with a large enough dataset to perform a solid analysis.

'Spotify API'

We then used the spotiy API to get the audio feature of the songs we wanted to analyse. 

In order to use the spotify API, we had to use a new library 'spotipy'.
Spotipy is a library created by Spotify to access all the music data provided by Spotify. 

In order to analyse our songs, we had to add them into plalists on Spotify. 
We therefore created playlists with the top 20 songs per year under the profile XXX. We left this playlists public as we believe in the importance
of Open Data. This would allow other people to use it too. 

From what we obtained with Spotify API, we created our final dataset to analyse. 

* ANALYSIS * 

k-means and PCA
Both principal components analysis (PCA) and k-means were used in this clustering analysis. 

Each song had multiple (11) dimensions, which were each of the audio features. PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality, which would help reduce the noise in the k-means clustering algorithm. It was used to essentially standardized and whiten the data. In this analysis, 9 dimensions were dropped. 

K-means clustering was then used to find the natural groupings of songs. Since the PCA retained components with the highest variance, the clusters will be more visible as they will be the most spread out. PCA 1 accounts for over 25% of the variance while PCA 2 accounts for approximately 13% of the variance. 

The elbow method suggested 3 groupings. The first group (named as cluster 0) includes songs such as Hello by Adele, Rosanna by Toto and Take Me Home, Country Roads by John Denver. The second group (named as cluster 1) has songs such as ABC by The Jackson 5, Don’t Go Breaking My Heart by Elton John and Pompeii by Bastille. The third and final grouping (named as cluster 2) contains tracks such as I’ll Make Love To You by Boyz II Men, Perfect by Ed Sheeran and One More Try by George Michael. 

The first group is the smallest, containing only 30 songs. They had the lowest danceability and energy, with an average of 0.494 and 0.369 respectively on a 0 to 1 scale. These songs also had the highest acousticness at an average of 0.528 on a 0 to 1 scale. They also had the highest average tempo.

*** RESULTS ***

* VISUALISATION *

(Everyone) 

The results from our analysis allowed us to create a range of visulation displaying the evolution of the audio feautures of the top hits songs since 1970.

- Radar Chart 

(Radar Chart 1)
We created a radar chart to display the mean audio feautures of the top '20 hit songs per year' per decade. 

We can observe that top hit songs did evolved trough decades. This phenonomenon is even more accentuated when comparing audiofeatures of 1970 to 1979 hit songs
and 2010 to 2019 hit songs.

(Radar Chart 2)

We can see that in 50 years there has been a sharp decrease in  accousticness. However, the Energy and Danceabilty of songs has increased. Other features
have remained quite stable trough years. 
We can observe that the change has been gradual with 80s and 90s songs having already less accousticness and more energy and Danciceability than 70s songs. 

We can now see in more details how each audio feature evolved trough years:
