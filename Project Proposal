Outline of what a successful project will tell you about domain
By generalizing the pattern of hit songs over the decade, we would generate a formula that allows for future prediction. 
The longitudinal analysis of various factors shows the evolution of preference and the entire music industry, 
where the difference and connection between generations are demonstrated. 
We would also use music as a lens to observe the implicit change of our culture and society for a broader view.
