Context and motivation


Suggest Available Datasets
We will take advantage of Spotify‚Äôs API as it contains audio features and analysis of the range of tracks they offer on their platform.
As we are examining the popularity of songs, we will also require a ranking of these tracks. 
We have found some datasets on Billboard Hot 100 songs from a large range of years.

Outline of what a successful project will tell you about domain
By generalizing the pattern of hit songs over the decade, we would generate a formula that allows for future prediction. 
The longitudinal analysis of various factors shows the evolution of preference and the entire music industry, 
where the difference and connection between generations are demonstrated. 
We would also use music as a lens to observe the implicit change of our culture and society for a broader view.
