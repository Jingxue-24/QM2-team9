*** ABSTRACT ***

Suffice to say, music is in our lives in one form or another. On average, Americans spend more than 4.5 hours a day listening to music, with this figure increasing yearly (Nielsen, 2017). 
However, the way we interact with music has greatly changed over the years; from The Beatles to One Direction and from John Lennon to Justin Bieber. 
This project is aimed at exploring what made and still makes songs ‘popular’ in their time, enough for them to end up on the infamous American Billboard Hot 100 chart, 
and then to analyse and compare these seemingly subjective features in a data driven, reasoned way for definitive analysis. 
To make our research more specific, we have come up with the question ‘How have the audio features of US Billboard top 20 songs evolved over the past 50 years?’, 
which we have analysed using graphs made from Python. These include line graphs, K-means and PCA clustering, radar charts and regression. 
This analysis enabled us to focus on how specific audio features changed throughout the years. 

*** INTRODUCTION *** includes aims and lit review 

* AIMS *
1.	Explore what made songs popular in their time and how this has evolved. 
By analysing the popular songs of each year we will be able to analyse what makes these songs popular in a data driven way that looks at the songs themselves rather than supporting factors.

2.	Analyse and compare the composite factors of popular songs throughout the years and identify any trends. 
This is similar to our first aim, but with an added focus on the trends of popular songs which may be used to make thoughtful inferences on the society at the time as well as make simple predictions for popular songs in the immediate years. 

* LITTERATURE REVIEW *

We are all aware that popular music has evolved through time, and that the number one hit song in 2019 sounds very different to the number one hit song in 1970. 
However, a very small amount of research has been done to metrically show how music has changed throughout the years,  popular songs having often only 
been classified by genre. 

Current studies have also tried to address the lack of research in this niche, which can be seen in the article referenced, 
which mentions how evolution of music is characterised by the rise in pop songs (Lee Lin, 2012). 

The article does put effort into further analysing songs, such as analysing an audio feature such as beats per minute of a song.
However, this type of research again lacks specific analysis of the composition of songs and their audio features. 
The research does not evaluate the specific changes songs have undergone over time and it ‘smooths’ out the evolution in order to simplify it. 

This is where our research comes in. We will help tackle this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of the audio features 
that make up the Billboard top 20 songs across 50 years. 

These audio features are derived from Spotify itself, and include features such as, song length, danceability, energy, 
instrumentalness, acousticness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo and time signature. 

By analysing these specific audio features, we will better understand what specifically makes a song popular, 
whether it is a mix of features or a leading feature, and the way they have evolved to form patterns throughout the years.

* MOTIVATIONS *
This research has and also importantly, can have far reaching positive effects for music producers and possibly even consumers. Our research will be able to comprehensively explain the actual makeup for popular songs throughout the years. Producers will be able to use this research to help shape their songs to become popular. This doesn’t necessarily mean they will follow the most recent trends but if they want to model their songs off popular retro songs, they also have the data to do this. They can even use our recent data to aid predictions of the audio features of a popular song in the coming years which can be used in music production. 

Our data can also be used as a tool in conjunction with other research which has more detailed analysis of surrounding factors including environmental conditions to make more accurate predictions. It can also be used to comment on society and can even explain some reasons for societal behaviour. This is notably possibly because of the expansive breakdown of spotify’s audio features which goes further than the typical breakdown of length and artist but even explains features such as danceability, a crucial factor when understanding popular songs.

Consumers may even be interested to view this information to understand more about their tastes and preferences which can serve as a form of self-introspection.

*** METHODOLOY ***

* DATA SETS *

Data Sets

To perform our analysis, we decided to combine two data sets:  
the ‘Billboard Year End Hot 100 songs’ chart from 1970  to 2019 and the Spotify API.

These new dataset would allow us to analyze and create solid visualizations on the evolution of popular songs trough decades.



‘Year End, Hot 100 songs Billboard chart’

The Year End, Hot 100 songs Billboard chart ranks every year the most listened songs in the United States. 
Songs appearing on top of the chart can most of the time be considered as ‘very popular’.  

For our project, we decided to only keep the top 20 songs of the billboard chart each year between 1970 and 2019. 
We believed that the top 20 really represented the popular songs of the year. Moreover, choosing as much as 20 songs rather than less, 
left us with a large enough database to perform a solid analysis.

The billboard website only containing the charts up to 2006, we used the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 Wikipedia  Page, Billboard magazine rankings before 2006. 

Even if the reliability of the Wikipedia data can be questioned, the top 100 songs listed on the Wikipedia page between 2006 and 2020 exactly correspond to
the billboard chart. 

'Spotify API'

After having chosen the songs we wanted to analyze, we used the Spotify API to obtain the audio feature of our songs. 

In order to work with this Spotify API, we used a new python library 'Spotipy'.
‘Spotipy’ is a library created by Spotify to access all the music data provided by Spotify including
the audio features of a track.

In order for the Spotify API to analyze our tracks, we added the top 20 songs per year into playlists on Spotify :
We created four playlists with the top 20 songs per year per decade under the profile XXX. 
We left these playlists public and accessible to all as we believe in the importance of Open Data. 
This would allow other people to use it too if needed. 

We obtained our final data set to analyze. 

'Line graphs'
Line graph was chosen for the first stage of our data visualization. It can demonstrate the change and evolution over time simply and effectively. Line graphs illustrate some basic patterns and general trends through summary statistics such as mean and median. By comparing different data types, we can evaluate the data more comprehensively (e.g., is mean affected by outliers?). To avoid presenting a lot of graphs on one page, we adopted an interactive graph. In this way, viewers are allowed to choose the data they are interested in and see the comparison among factors. 

How we utilize Python to process line graphs:
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
Import pandas
Use plotly as the foundation of the graph (reference)

df1 = pd.read_csv('Data/median.csv')
fig1 = px.line(df1, x = 'Year', y = ['Median length', 'Median Danceability', 'Median Energy', 'Median Instrumentalness', 'Median Acousticness', 'Median Liveness', 'Median Loudness', 'Median Speechiness', 'Median Tempo', 'Median Time signature'], title = ‘Median')
Change elements to adapt our project.

fig1.write_html(‘Output/Median.html’)

Eventually, we convert the graphs into HTML files to insert them to our website.
* AUDIO FEATURES *

Below is a list of all the audio features we have included in our data analysis and their definitions. Spotify has also included popularity as an audio feature but as we have exclusively chosen ‘popular’ songs for our data, we felt there was no need to include this feature. We have included the rest to help provide a complete view of the makeup of a song.

Length: The duration of the track in milliseconds.

Danceability: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. 

Energy: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. 

Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.

Acousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.

Liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.

Loudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db. 

Speechiness: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. 

Tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.

Time Signature: An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).

* ANALYSIS * 

k-means and PCA
Both principal components analysis (PCA) and k-means were used in this clustering analysis. 

Each song had multiple (11) dimensions, which were each of the audio features. PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality, which would help reduce the noise in the k-means clustering algorithm. It was used to essentially standardized and whiten the data. In this analysis, 9 dimensions were dropped. 

K-means clustering was then used to find the natural groupings of songs. A Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test was used to test the suitability of the data. With a KMO value of 0.596 the sample adequacy is almost mediocre. It indicates the our data is not the most suitable for clustering, meaning we can not heavily rely on the outcome of the k-means clustering. 

Since the PCA retained components with the highest variance, the clusters will be more visible as they will be the most spread out. PCA 1 accounts for over 25% of the variance while PCA 2 accounts for approximately 13% of the variance. [insert variance_pcs.png]

The elbow method suggested 3 groupings.  [insert k-means pca graph.png]

The first group (named as cluster 0) includes songs such as I’ll Make Love to You by Boyz II Men, If I Ain’t Got You by Alicia Keys and Perfect by Ed Sheeran. Cluster 0 is the smallest, containing only 30 songs. They had the lowest danceability and energy, with an average of 0.494 and 0.369 respectively on a 0 to 1 scale. These songs also had the highest chance of being acoustic at an average confidence measure of 0.528 on a 0 to 1 scale. They also had the highest average tempo of 120.548 bpm. This cluster is also the only one with an average time signature of 3 over 4 - perhaps the defining factor of this cluster. 

The second grouping (named as cluster one) is the largest one, including songs such as Rolling in the Deep by Adele, Ain't No Mountain High Enough by Diana Ross and Baby Got Back by Sir Mix-A-Lot. It contains, on average, the shortest songs with the highest danceability of 0.699 on a 0 to 1 scale. Cluster 1 has the lowest chance of being acoustic with a confidence of 0.107 and the highest average time signature of 4.005 over 4 (all songs bar 3 have 4/4 time signature). It also has the highest speechiness of 0.087. 

The third and last grouping (named as cluster two) contains 322 songs, including ABC by The Jackson 5, Rosanna by TOTO and Love Yourself by Justin Bieber. Cluster 2 had the, on average, longest songs with the slowest average tempo of 114.626 bpm. Cluster 2 songs have an average danceability of 0.584 on a 0 to 1 scale. All have a time signature of 4/4. 

(if you can add the example songs that would be awesome!)

~ Below is more discussion stuff ~

Time Signature
Only 33 songs from our dataset of 989 songs have a time signature that is not 4/4 - this is 3.3%. Looking through an electrophysiological lens, a binary metric organization such as 2/4 or 4/4 is arguably the human default system for Western listeners. There are faster brain responses for disruptions to binary structures, suggesting they are easier to process, and hence to enjoy. 

Release Year [insert interactive box plot html file]
These three box plots highlight the spread of release years for each cluster (0,1,2). 75% of the songs in Cluster 0 are between 1978 and 2001. This is a large range, potentially due to this cluster being the smallest one (30 songs). 

In Cluster 1, 75% of the songs were released between 1988 and 2010. This can be classified as the 90s and 00s. The 90s was a period that could not necessarily be defined - it saw the continuation of dance-pop and RnB from the 80s and the rise of grunge with bands like Nirvana. More importantly, in 1991, the Billboard charts changed to reflect sales figures rather than record salespeople’s projections, making them more diversified. The 2000s saw the introduction of online music services, such as Napster, increasing the rate at which music could be shared and consumed. The same diversity of the 90s continued into the 2000s as artists like Ne-Yo and Katy Perry both competing for the top spots. 

Cluster 2 focuses between mid 70s and mid 90s - 75% of the songs were released between 1976 and 1994. The 70s and 80s saw the popularity of rock rise, with bands like the The Police and Eagles. With MTV launching in the 80s, it defined culture and music visually. 
 
Acoustic-ness, Length and Tempo [insert k_all_acoustic_length.html ]
This scatterplot highlights that Cluster 1 songs are very unlikely to be acoustic. These songs are predominantly from the 90s and 00s, which corresponds to the rising popularity of electronic (dance) music and also its influence in pop music. Taking songs that aren’t acoustic as electronically-based, a reason why electronic music would be popular (with Cluster 1 constituting over 60% of our dataset) is due to the unique complexities and varied sonic textures it can introduce that aren’t available with traditional instruments. Cluster 2 songs are scattered throughout the acoustic scale on the plot, but they tend to be more likely to be acoustic. Acoustic songs provide the break and diversity perhaps needed in to an electronic-filled music scene.

The length and tempo of songs stays consistent throughout clusters and acoustic confidence measures - with some anomalies. 

Danceability, Energy and Tempo [insert k_all_dance_energy.html ]
This scatterplot shows a positive association between energy and danceability - the more energy a song has, the more suitable it is for dancing. 

Majority of the top Billboard songs, and those in cluster 1, in the dataset have high energy and high danceability. Assuming that popular songs are those that make the listener feel happy, there is evidence that high energy songs (upbeat) boost one’s mood. Music can be more effective at eliciting positive emotions than a visual stimulus, especially when attached to personal memories. 

In regards to tempo, as seen by the size of each scatter point, lower tempos are considered low energy and danceable songs. Higher tempo means that there are more beats per minute, which - according to MRIs - activate motor areas of the brain. This causes us to move to the rhythm (read: dance), hence fast tempo songs are linked to higher danceability, which is a happy state, proving to be a potential justification for popularity.

Rather than group the visualisations by audio features, we decided on grouping by summary statistics e.g.  displaying the mean of all the features in one graph. This was so you could compare the trends each audio feature followed to perhaps make simple observations on whether certain audio features matched up in their trend. The interactive graph adjusts it’s scale for the audio features displayed at that moment. We recommend that you view Danceability, Energy, Acousticness and Liveness together, Speechiness and Instrumentalness together and the rest on their own because of the scales of measurement of each feature discussed in the definitions. 


The summary statistics we will be looking at are Mean, Maximum, Minimum, Median, Standard Deviation and Variance. Each of these have specific purposes: The mean will tell us a general average and is useful in then allocating a specific number that can act as a makeshift model for producers. The maximum and minimum can help identify any limits of audio features that popular songs have tended to follow. The median can help identify whether the middle value has tended to be higher or lower which can help aid our interpretations of the spread of the data. The standard deviation can help indicate the spread of the data in relation to the mean and the variance can help indicate variability of the data. All of these are important in determining if there is a specific identity to popular songs and their audio features, or is data largely spread out which can suggest there is many varieties of popular songs and their audio features.

Length:
The mean peaked at just under 300 000 mili seconds in 1979 but has since undergone a genral trend decreasing in size which indicates shorter songs are becoming more and more popular. Having said that, the maximum and minimum have widely varied in size with recent figures have eclipsed the 300 000 mark and the minimum has gone below half that telling us the longer and shorter songs still have the ability to be popular. The median of the length has followed a similar trend to the mean and so has the standard deviation and the variance. This suggests that whilst longer popular songs do exist, the trend is towards shorter songs and popular songs are tending to follow this trend largely which has decreased the variation in size and distance from the mean of the length of songs. 

Danceability:
Danceability has been on a general trend of increase as suggested by the graph of the mean. Notably, the value never falls below 0.5 indicating that high danceability has always been a common theme amongst popular songs throughout the years and is recently increasingly so.  The maximum has has risen to above 0.9 but has not followed an overall trend but the minimum has been on a trend of increase since 2004 indicating the lower end of the spectrum are becoming more danceable which has contributed to an increase in the mean. As expected, the median has also followed a trend of increase whereas from 2005, the variance and standard deviation have both followed trends of decrease as more songs become more danceable and the spread of data decreases. 

Energy:
The mean of energy had overgone a general trend of increase until 2010 where it has decreased over the last 10 years returning to levels reached during the 1970’s. It should be noted that like danceability, the mean has almost always been above 0.5 which implies popular songs are relatively energetic. The maximum has tended to reach high levels consistently meaning highly energetic songs have always been part of the popular song spectrum and the minimum has been volatile but tended to be above 0.3 in the last 20 years so popular songs are not extremetly low energy.  The median is similar to the mean but the variance and standard deviation have both been quite volatile but between smaller scales hence the spread of data can be larger and smaller in different years but both measures are quite low so songs tend to be less variable in terms of energy.

Instrumentalness:
 The mean of instrumentalness was closer to 0.1 during the 1970’s but since there the mean has been close to 0 with some years reaching 0 in the last 10 years. The maximum from the 1970’s has reached higher levels but the past 10 years. Has also been closer 0 .1 with the minimum constantly 0. The median is similar to the mean. The standard deviation and variance have also tended to be closer to 0 with some outliers in the earlier years during the 1970’s. It seems that popular songs have almost always had low levels of instrumentalness especially in the last decade and there hasn’t been much difference in the data points as the spread suggests. 

Acousticness: 

Over the past 50 years there has been a trend of decrease in mean acousticness although the last 5 years has shown a slight trend of increase but still at low numbers. The maximum has been volatile with extremely varying figures whereas the minimum has been close to 0 since the 1980’s. The median has also been following a trend of decrease bar the last 2 years but again still low figures under 0.2. The variance and standard deviation have both been volatile suggesting high variability of data and a larger spread although with standard deviation, figures have not climbed above 0.32 thus, the spread of data has changed but is generally not far from the mean. 

Liveness: 

The mean of liveness has not followed an overall trend but has been typically between 0.1 and 0.25 which are low figures. The maximum and minimum have both followed extremely volatile trends liveness in popular songs have varied from year to year. The median has been similar to the mean whereas standard deviation and variance had both also been volatile although at lower values. This indicates spread of data has changed supporting the lack of trend but has not been great at each time. 

Loudness:
Since the mid 1980’s, the mean for the loudness has undergone a significant trend of increase and so has the maximum and minimum. The median has also reflected this and naturally, the variance and standard deviation has undergone the opposite trend telling us that across the data songs are tending to increase in the loudness and there is little variation around this.  

Speechiness:

Since, the 1990’s, there has been a trend of increase followed by a decrease in the mean but notably all below 0.15 which indicates a low level of speechiness in popular songs throughout the decades. The maximum has followed this trend with values never climbing bove 0.5 bar 2007 where it was 0.576 thus, there is a possibility of a popular song to have an element of speechiness although evidently by the mean, not high. The minimum has not followed a specific trend but has been notoriously low throughout. The standard deviation and variance have fluctualted in the past few decades but at low figures indication a small spread of data and low variability. Therefore, popular songs mostly tend to have low speechiness. 

Tempo:
The mean of tempo has not followed a specific trend but has largely followed the moderato category of tempo (Fernández-Sotos et al., 2016). The maximum and minimum both rise and fall to extremely low levels respectively so there is potential for both sides of the spectrum to become popular songs. The median is similar to the mean but the standard deviation and variance have both fluctuated but at significant levels which means there is a large spread of data and variability. Therefore, popular songs are not necessarily moderato but they could equally be higher and lower levels consistently. 

Time Signature:

Whilst the time signature has no overall trend in the mean, it has always revolved between 3.9 and 4 except 1991 which was 4.05. The maximum and minimum have levels of 3 and 5 and the median is 4 constantly. The low variance and standard deviation show little variation and it’s clear popular songs have always been around the 4 beats per bar mark for time signature which should be compared with the tempo and other beat related features.

Summary:
The above summaries help provide a rough picture on the trends of audio features and also the levels they have been at in popular songs. These can be used as a model of a popular song but it should be noted that songs may have different combinations of these audio features and stating these figures as model numbers may be inaccurate as specific songs may have different audio features at different levels which average out to these levels which can then be misleading. The variance and standard deviation have helped provide a clearer picture on whether the mean may be representative of all the data and the clustering detailed elsewhere will help shed light on the interaction of audio features.

*** RESULTS ***

* VISUALISATION *

(Everyone) 

The results we obtained from our analysis allowed us to create a range of visualization displaying top hit songs 
and their audio features evolved since 1970.

- Radar Chart 

First we created radar charts to show how the average songs evolved trough decades in the last 50 years.

(Radar Chart 1)

The radar chart above displays the mean audio features of the top '20 hit songs per year' per decade. 
We can observe that top hit songs did evolve trough decades and that their audio features changed trough time. 
This phenomenon is even more accentuated when comparing the hit songs of the 70’s and of the 10’s. 

(Radar Chart 2)

We can see that in 50 years there has been a sharp decrease in the accousticness of popular songs meaning 
that more songs now have electronically produced sounds. 
However, the Energy and Danceability of songs has increased meaning that today’s track are more suitable for dancing 
and can be described as ‘more intense’ than songs in the 1970’s. However, other features such as speechless and instrumentalness 
have remained quite stable trough years. 

We can observe that the changes have been gradual with 80s and 90s songs having already less accousticness and more energy and Danceability than 70s songs. 

Interactive radar chart: 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-radar" data-src="visualisation/4851600"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


We can now see in more details how each audio feature evolved trough years:

*REGRESSION*

Another way to further analyse how these audio features have evolved through time is by performing linear regression analysis. 
This will show if there is a trend in how the audio feature was altered through time.

(Graph 1)

Tempo: As shown in the graph, as time goes by, the tempo of songs increases. As seen by the units, however, the tempo only increases by roughly 1 beat per minute 
from 1970 to 2020, which is not such a significant difference. This shows that most popular songs throughout time, then, have had a similar tempo, 
and that the pace of a song might be an important factor to consider when trying to compose a hit song. 

(Graph 2)

Speechiness: The graph shows that as years go by, songs have more spoken words instead of longer parts of instrumentation. 
This might be due to the rise of rap music in the 21st century, which is made up of far more words than a song of other genres. 

(Graph 3)

Loudness: As years go by, the average loudness of a track (measured in decibels from -60 to 0 dB) increases by around 7 dB. 
An explanation could be that since the late 1980s, the music industry has been using a production trick to make songs appear louder, as they pushed to make each track 
more impactful than the next, in a sort of ‘sonic arms race’. The trick is called ‘dynamic range compression’, which boosts quieter parts of the song so that the music 
appears louder overall. 

(Graph 4)

Length: As years go by, the length of hit songs has decreased by 17,500 milliseconds on average from 1970 to 2020. 
While it may seem like a lot, it is only 0.29 minutes (17.5 seconds), which is not as significant as it may seem. However, a possible explanation of this could be 
the rise of streaming services, such as Spotify. Now, instead of getting paid by physical sales, artists get paid by streams, which only count if you listen to at 
least 30 seconds of a song. If an artist releases an album full or shorter songs, because they will get paid for every song you listen to, having short songs is beneficial 
as it increases the streaming rate, whether or not you listen to the whole album.   

(Graph 5)

Instrumentalness: From the graph, we can see how instrumentalness has decreased throughout the years.  
The closer the value is to 1.0, the closer the song has no vocal content. The opposite is occurring in this graph, where the vocal content is 
increasing through time. Again, this could be due to the rise in popularity of rap music. 

(Graph 6)

Energy: The intensity and activity (energy) of hit songs has increased by around 0.2 throughout the years. 
This could be due to the fact that tempo and loudness have increased too, both of which greatly affect the overall energy of a song. 

(Graph 7)

Danceability: Hit songs have become more ‘danceable’ through time. What could explain this is the rise in ‘clubbing culture’, concerts and festivals, 
where the more a song is able to be danced to, the more it is played and the more fun people have. A song becomes popular based on streams, so if a song is 
upbeat and danceable, chances are it is going to be played in locations from those mentioned above, to pop radios, shops and restaurants, increasing its popularity. 

* EVALUATION*

* DISCUSSION* 
Some of these findings yield some unsurprising information whilst others uncover and prove some beliefs about societies. As mentioned, the length of the track has been decreasing. This is likely because of the rise of streaming services which has allowed artists autonomy over their song length whereas they used to be forced to follow the typical length of the radio slot. This, coupled with shorter attention spans in societies has led to shorter songs (Bemrose, B. 2019). There is an interesting question on whether by appeasing shorter attention spans, this encourages them to shorten further. The continuous decrease in song length would seem to initially support this but more research is likely needed.

The trend in danceability seems logical especially considering the rise of dance-based songs. The rise of TikTok and other social media sites support the production of songs which includes danceability as a key feature. It comes as no surprise that danceability is on the rise and it should be expected to remain a prominent audio feature. Energetic songs remain high although have decreased somewhat which could be the result of the effects of changing tastes. It’s clear different decades have undergone different evolutions of music tastes and although current music is still energetic, it may not be as energetic as previous tastes. This may even be the after effects of changing tastes decades ago where punk rock, highly energetic songs, started to phase out and songs are still adapting to this change. The tempo of songs as discussed has followed many different types and this may reflect the diverse tastes in every population. The tempo levels also have strong links to emotional intensity and valence, and it may be that these changing attitudes are reflections of these links. Higher tempo tends to be more linked to emotional valence and less so in emotional intensity whereas medium tempo songs are the opposite so songs can shift to cater to the society’s needs (Liu et al., 2018)

The Liveness and Loudness trends are unsurprising as the recording technology has drastically improved, there is a larger focus of the recording studio and the ability for songs to raise volume has improved also. 

The low level of speechiness is also not astounding especially considering it has been a constant in this regard throughout the decades. It seems popular songs, and maybe general songs, have low levels of spoken word in a track which is natural because of the distinction between a song and a poet and the mainstream nature of songs in comparison. This is similar with instrumentalness as it always seems to never have been an important audio feature to accentuate. 		

 Time signature has also been a constant but acousticness has experienced some fluctuation but again, it likely reflects the changing preferences of the society and the nature of those themes. It’s also a reflection of new technology which has allowed musicians to not have to rely on production methods and instruments that tend to be more acoustic in nature as discussed (Dredge, 2013).

 *** LIMITS ***
 
 
- We decided to only study the top 20 songs of the billboard each year. 
This might be too restrictive or still to broad. Choosing a different definition of what is a popular song might have completely changed our study.

- We decided to use the billboard chart to define the songs to analzse. 
However, this chart ends up representing mostly the popular songs among teenagers and young adults 
as they are the one listening the most to music rather than representing the popular songs among the population of the United States.

- Even if Spotify gives a short definition of their audio features, they are not very well defined 
therefore, we cannot be complty  sure of their signification and their reliability.

- The environmental conditions at the time which may have affected popularity of a song are not taken into account.
