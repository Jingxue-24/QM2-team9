Context and motivation


Suggest Available Datasets
We will take advantage of Spotify‚Äôs API as it contains audio features and analysis of the range of tracks they offer on their platform.
As we are examining the popularity of songs, we will also require a ranking of these tracks. 
We have found some datasets on Billboard Hot 100 songs from a large range of years.

**Suggest/sketch methods for analysis/processing of data**

After cleaning our data we would like to compare the audio features of the top hit songs per year / decades. 
We would analyse the dancibility, tempo‚Ä¶ of the top 10 songs of each year to see how popular songs have evolved through time. 
We would calculate the mean of each audio feature per year to see how the perfect hit songs was each year in the last 50 year and how it changed.
We would also analyse other aspects of hit songs such as the mood, duration of the song‚Ä¶



Suggest/sketch methods for presenting data/results 
We would like to present our data using a range of visualisations. These include maps to indicate the location of origin of hit songs and where they are most popular, radar charts and continuous colour scales to display comparisons among different factors (danceability, tempo‚Ä¶) and line-type graphs to show the evolution of factors through the years. We would also like to make some of the graphs comparing factors of hit songs interactive, so one can easily visualise their evolution through the years. 



Outline of what a successful project will tell you about domain
By generalizing the pattern of hit songs over the decade, we would generate a formula that allows for future prediction. 
The longitudinal analysis of various factors shows the evolution of preference and the entire music industry, 
where the difference and connection between generations are demonstrated. 
We would also use music as a lens to observe the implicit change of our culture and society for a broader view.
